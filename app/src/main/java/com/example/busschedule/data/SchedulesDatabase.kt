     * later, we will add @Volatile annotation somewhere to help reduce the overhead as well.
     *
     * this class also holds all the DAOs related to the database in question. This allows for it to
     * inject those DAOs anywhere they are needed. Similar to Service being injected in previous projects.
     * The DAO is actually just a service
     *
     * this class has a function that when called, returns the instance of the db. if there is already one,
     * it is returned. otherwise, one is made and assigned to the instance variable and returned
     *
     * We need a companion object to do so. why? well, we cant instantiate this class but we need access inside
     * it and the only things that lets us do so are objects
